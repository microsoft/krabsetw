# Parity with the C++/CLI implementation

`O365.Security.ETW.Managed` is a pure .NET reimplementation of the C++/CLI wrapper in
`Microsoft.O365.Security.Native.ETW`, which is itself a thin layer over the native
`krabs` headers. The two are meant to be drop-in interchangeable for consumers.

The parity suite (`tests/ManagedETWTests`, compiled twice — once against each
implementation) is the mechanical check. This file records the things that suite
*cannot* tell you: where the two implementations deliberately differ, where they agree
in a way that looks wrong, and known defects that are still open on one side or both.

## Why the parity suite is not sufficient on its own

The parity tests are written against behaviour krabs already has, so they only exercise
mechanisms that exist in both implementations. Anything the port *added* is invisible to
them by construction.

The clearest example: krabs recomputes every property offset from scratch on each
access, while the port memoises them behind a high-water mark. A bug in that memoisation
cannot be expressed as a parity failure, because there is nothing on the krabs side to
diverge from. One such bug shipped and was found by accident (see
`OffsetResolverTests`); the general guard against the class of bug is
`OffsetResolverDifferentialTests`, which differences memoised resolution against a fresh
resolver per access.

Tests covering port-only state live in `managed/tests/O365.Security.ETW.Managed.Tests`
and should be validated by mutation — reintroduce the defect and confirm the test fails —
rather than assumed to work.

## Deliberate divergences

### Case folding above U+007F

`SpanCompare.ToUpper(char)` folds ASCII inline and falls back to
`char.ToUpperInvariant` for everything else. krabs uses the CRT's `towupper`, and
because nothing in the codebase ever calls `setlocale`, the CRT stays in the `"C"`
locale and folds ASCII only.

So the port case-folds *more* than C++/CLI does. A case-insensitive filter written
against a non-ASCII string will match in the port where it would not have matched in
C++/CLI.

This is intentional. The alternative — matching krabs by restricting to ASCII — makes
case-insensitive matching silently ineffective for non-ASCII input, which in a security
filter means missed detections rather than extra ones. Kept as an improvement.

Note the byte overload, `SpanCompare.ToUpper(byte)`, is ASCII-only in both
implementations: case folding a single byte is not well defined without knowing the code
page.

### `DateTime` property signature

Documented at the call site in `EventRecordAdapter`. Deliberate and load-bearing for
source compatibility.

### Structs are not decoded

The port returns -1 from `OffsetResolver.SizeOf` for a property carrying
`PropertyStruct` rather than attempting to size it, which makes that property and
everything after it unreadable. This was scoped out of the initial milestone and has not
been revisited.

krabs does not handle structs either, but it fails differently and worse — see below.

## Things that look like divergences and are not

### `TDH_INTYPE_MANIFEST_COUNTEDBINARY` length prefix

Both implementations include the two-byte length prefix in the returned buffer. krabs
has no special handling for the type, `krabs::binary` is a raw byte copy, and
`TdhGetPropertySize` reports the size including the prefix. The port matches.

An earlier review noted this as a divergence. That note was wrong.

### Oversized fixed-width properties

`TryGetFixed` requires an exact size match, so a fixed-width read against a property
whose schema length disagrees fails rather than truncating. This matches krabs. An
earlier note claiming the port truncated was stale.

## Known defects

### krabs mis-sizes struct properties (open, C++ side, affects shipping code)

`krabs/size_provider.hpp` checks `PropertyParamLength` and `propertyInfo.length`, but
never tests the `PropertyStruct` flag before reading `propertyInfo.nonStructType.InType`.
For a struct property that union member holds a struct-member start index and count, so
krabs interprets a member index as a TDH in-type, derives a size from it, and silently
misaligns every subsequent property in the event.

This is a real bug in the shipping implementation. It is untested on both sides. The
port avoids it by refusing to size structs at all, which fails visibly instead.

### ANSI decoding ignores the out-type (open, both sides)

`TDH_OUTTYPE_STRING` means the ANSI code page, but `TDH_OUTTYPE_UTF8` (35) and
`TDH_OUTTYPE_JSON` (34) mean UTF-8, and `TDH_OUTTYPE_XML` (28) defers to the document's
own encoding declaration. Neither implementation branches on the out-type; both decode
ANSI string in-types using the ANSI code page unconditionally.

A sweep of the 1503 providers registered on a build machine found 4163 ANSI-typed string
properties: 4162 `TDH_OUTTYPE_STRING`, one `win:Xml`, and zero UTF-8 or JSON. So this is
currently theoretical. Tracked separately for both implementations.

Note that `TdhOutType` in the port had these two values numbered three too high until
recently; the enum in `tdh.h` is implicitly numbered and the transcription had drifted.
Values are now spelled out explicitly.

### C++/CLI truncates ANSI strings at an embedded NUL

`EventRecord.hpp` decodes via `gcnew String(str.c_str())`, which stops at the first NUL.
The port decodes the full property length. Only reachable for ANSI in-types that are not
NUL-terminated, i.e. the counted and non-NUL-terminated variants.

## Resolved

### ANSI string decoding used UTF-8

The port decoded `TDH_INTYPE_ANSISTRING` and friends as UTF-8, so any byte above 0x7F
became U+FFFD — lossy and unrecoverable. C++/CLI was already correct
(`marshal_as<std::string>` and `gcnew String(const char*)` are both CP_ACP).

Fixed by `Interop.AnsiEncoding`, which resolves the code page from `GetACP()`.
`Encoding.Default` is not usable here: it is CP_ACP on .NET Framework but UTF-8 on .NET,
which would make the two target frameworks disagree.

Covered by `describe_EventRecord.it_should_parse_ansi_strings_outside_of_ascii`, which
runs against both implementations.
